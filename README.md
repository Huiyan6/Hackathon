# Hackathon
This is a project made for the 2024 HACKED BETA Hackathon at the University of Alberta hosted by the CompEClub

In this project, we aim to solve the unfortunate struggles of student life;
Reading a textbook is hard and time-consuming work. When we can all be using our time better by scrolling through TikTok or Instagram reels, who wants to read a boring old textbook?

This is a software application that can:

1. Analyze the text on your screen and read it out loud to you
   - this is done by using image recognition to turn the words on your screen into a string and passing that string into a text-to-speech API
2. Flip pages
   This is the hardest part of the project, and it can best be understood by looking at the code files.

All files are in the Master Branch because I dont know how to add it to the main branch
