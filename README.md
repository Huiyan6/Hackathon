# Hackathon
This is a project made for the 2024 HACKED BETA Hackathon at the University of Alberta hosted by the CompEClub

In this project, we aim to solve the unfortunate struggles of student life;
Reading a textbook is hard and time-consuming work. When we can all be using our time better by scrolling through TikTok or Instagram reels, who wants to read a boring old textbook?

This is a software application that can:

1. Analyze the text on your screen and read it out loud to you
   - this is done by using image recognition to turn the words on your screen into a string and passing that string into a text-to-speech API
Sadly we couldn't get the autoscrolling to work, so this is all we have, and the UI button is kinda broken and can only run once
